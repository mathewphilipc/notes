# Undergraduate General Relativity

In Spring 2025 I was the teaching assistant for General Relativity (PHYS-UA 170) under professor Monica Pate. These are the notes I produced for recitations. Global topic selection was at the discretion of Professor Pate, while local material is my original work. The schedule of topics was as follows.

[Recitation 1: Vector Calculus Review](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/vector_calculus_review.pdf)

[Recitation 2: Isometries and Coordinate Changes](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/isometries_and_coordinate_changes.pdf)
