# Undergraduate General Relativity

In Spring 2025 I was the teaching assistant for General Relativity (PHYS-UA 170), taught by professor Monica Pate at New York University. These are the notes I produced for recitations. Global topic selection was at the discretion of Professor Pate, while local material is my original work. The schedule of topics was as follows.

[Recitation 1: Vector Calculus Review](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/vector_calculus_review.pdf)

[Recitation 2: Isometries and Coordinate Changes](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/isometries_and_coordinate_changes.pdf)

[Recitation 3: Lagrange and Noether](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/lagrange_and_noether.pdf)

[Recitation 4: Spacetime](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/spacetime.pdf)

[Recitation 5: Linear Algebra With and Without Indices](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/linear_algebra_indices.pdf)

[Recitation 6: Invariants and Electromagnetism](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/invariants_electromagnetism.pdf)

[Recitation 7: Geometry in Curved Backgrounds](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/geometry_in_curved_backgrounds.pdf)

[Recitation 8: Review and Geodesics](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/relativity_curved_space_geodesics.pdf)

(Recitation 9 followed Professor Pate's own notes on orbital mechanics in a fixed curved background)

[Recitation 10: More Linear Algebra](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/more_linear_algebra.pdf)

(Recitation 11 larged followed previous TA Tony Zhou's notes on the stress tensor)

[Recitation 12: Free Fall](https://github.com/mathewphilipc/notes/blob/main/undergraduate_general_relativity/free_fall.pdf)
